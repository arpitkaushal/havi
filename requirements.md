### Prepare the following UI.

- A form with 10 fields that can be embedded in any of the websites using iframe and will collect records at a single location. The form should have a password field, image upload field, at least one date field and at least one PDF file attachment. You can assume the remaining fields yourself.
- An admin grid to showcase all the records.
- Admin can add descriptive notes to any of the records.
- Admin can create and assign tags to any of the records.
- Admin can filter, sort and search the records with any of the fields including notes.
- Admin grid will have 5 fields by default but admin can configure which fields they want to see in the grid.


### Prepare an architecture and write RESTful APIs/Microservices for:

- Consider email address as primary key.
- Collecting and saving the form data.
- Populating the grid and adding notes.
- In case of repeated submission, update candidate details with latest details and keep track of dates of each of the applications.
- Generate, save and showcase the thumbnail of the image submitted.
- Build a search engine to find candidates based on any of the fields including the notes.


### Deliverables

- Development document. Purpose of this is to explain the development process in a way so other developers can understand and proceed if they want to make changes in your application.
- API document
- A URL of functional application
- Source code of front and backend on git only.
